# How to Contribute

1Hive is an open community, if you see something that needs doing then get involved and try and fix it. You can discuss issues with the relevant [Swarm](../../community/swarms/) and if it doesn't fit anywhere or it's something that requires independent work, you can create a proposal for funding to do it independently.

Sign up to the weekly Pollen distribution and [earn pollen](earn-pollen.md) which rewards individuals for contributing to the Discourse, Discord and Github. More details can be seen here.

Contribute to governance by either [creating or voting on a proposal ](../../projects/honey-pot/conviction-voting.md)in 1hive.org
