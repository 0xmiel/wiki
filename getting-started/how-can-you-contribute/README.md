# How Can You Contribute?

1Hive is an open community, if you see something that needs doing then get involved and try and fix it. You can discuss issues with the relevant Swarm's and if it doesn't fit anywhere or it's something that requires independent work, you can create a proposal for funding to do it.

Sign up to the weekly Pollen distribution which rewards individuals for contributing to the Discourse, Discord and Github. More details can be seen here.
