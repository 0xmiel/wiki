# Welcome to 1Hive NEW!

1Hive is an organisation that builds and experiments with transparent and inclusive organisational infrastructure. Part of the experiment, and to sustain development, involves building an economy around a currency called Honey, which is used to influence the direction of the community. Anyone can buy honey online or earn it through 1Hive and can use it to vote on funding proposals and protocol changes with a weight that is equal to the Honey they hold.

1Hive has been distributing Honey to contributors for over a year. Up until recently it was worth 0 but then it was made available on an exchange at which point it gained a value. 1Hive has never done a crowdsale to raise funds to operate. However, since there was interest in our protocol, people bought the Honey token from the exchange which increased its value. Since the 1Hive protocol creates Honey, allowing Honey holders to control its distribution, this meant the organisation could sustain itself.

## Distribution

The current distribution of Honey is still fairly concentrated amongst the original contributors. As time progresses it is expected that Honey distribution will become more evenly spread out given its high availability. Further to this 1Hive is building a service called Celeste which will be used to prevent large Honey holders from forcing through bad decisions that aren't in line with 1Hive's established goals. 1Hive also strive's to minimise any decisions that require Honey holders to vote. We do this by integrating as many configuration updates as possible into the 1Hive protocol, which will update automatically in response to various events.

## Celeste

Celeste answers questions by asking them to a random selection of users. The users do not know each other but must answer the same as the majority. Anyone not answering the same as the majority will lose money, anyone answering along with the majority will make money. It is expected this will lead users to answer in accordance with established community values and norms. Within the 1Hive protocol Celeste will not be used to decide a vote's outcome but will be used to decide whether or not a vote belongs within the organisation.

## Gardens

The next step for 1Hive is to generalise the infrastructure we build and experiment with to allow other communities to use it. Allowing them to raise funds and make decisions amongst themselves effectively. To do this we are building what we call Gardens through which communities can launch their own token with their own issuance policy. To give the token value they will either use a crowdsale or convince the 1Hive community to give up some Honey to provide value for their token on an exchange. From there they can use whatever tools they like for coordination, and the token will be used for deciding how funds are used and how their infrastructure is configured, the same as the 1Hive protocol.

We hope that this will encourage and give more opportunities to people to contribute to causes they care about. Since having a say in a Garden is as simple as buying its token, individuals can very easily donate and have a stake in a cause they believe is worth pursuing. They are then incentivised to further that cause in the hope of increasing its token's value. This is not too dissimilar to equity in traditional businesses but with significantly less overhead and significantly greater inclusivity.

To begin with it is expected that Gardens will be created for software based projects and online communities, but ultimately it is hoped it could be used for any causes that belong in the public domain.

## Getting Started

1Hive is an open community, you do not need to ask permission to join or become a member. If you see something you think should be improved, you can make a proposal to get Honey and make it happen.
