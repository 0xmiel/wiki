# Wiki Contribution

1Hive is a large sprawling ecosystem of many different projects that are continually in development. Maintaining a Wiki is important to ensure that there is a concise overview of the state of 1hive. Everyone is encouraged to contribute to the 1hive wiki. 

At the very least one member from each swarm will have write access to update the wiki to ensure details about their swarm and associated projects are accurate. Anyone without write access is still able to update a page on the wiki, or the wiki's structure, through Github using a pull request.

## Editing using Github

### First Time Editing Steps

1. To edit a page without explicit write access requires a Github account. Create one here: [http://github.com/](http://github.com/)
2. Fork the Wiki from the 1Hive Github organisation to your own Github account by going to this link and clicking fork in the top right: [https://github.com/1Hive/wiki](https://github.com/1Hive/wiki) 

### Post Setup Steps

1. Within the Wiki repo forked to your own Github account, navigate to the file you wish to change and edit the file directly in your web browser by clicking on the pencil icon in the top right of the files border. Each file represents a page on the wiki, the names should represent those seen through the GitBook website.
2. Use Github markdown to format your entry: [https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
3. Commit your change by scrolling to the bottom, entering a commit message and clicking Commit.
4.
