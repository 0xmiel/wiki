Although the hope is to release the product soon, we do not want to rush deliveries.

**What about Marketing?**  
Marketing will begin as soon as Agave is deployed, as presented in the roadmap. Any indirect marketing before token launch will just occur through proposals, documentation, token listings. 

Our main marketing push will be in coordination with Agave's deployment, [Celeste](https://1hive.gitbook.io/celeste/), Honeyswap v3, to promote the entire 1hive ecosystem as a whole.

**Is $AGVE on Coingecko?**  
Yes! Here’s the link: [$AGVE - Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/agave-token).

**Can I contribute in some way?**

As of now a few bounties are open, and you can check them all [here](https://www.notion.so/3e13ef2a5d614a828b684640af2212b4?v=20b21ead637341faa87416b85202b584) and claim them by getting in touch with Buzz Dao. We are working on a proposal to create new bounties accessible to all users, mostly related to token listings. \(Coinmarketcap, Blockfolio, Dappradar, Coinpaprika, Dune Analytics etc\)

[Here](https://info.honeyswap.org/token/0x3a97704a1b25f08aa230ae53b352e2e72ef52843) you can see Agve's chart from the Honeyswap analytics page.

**Where can I track LP rewards?**  
LP tracking can be found on [Liquidityfolio ](https://www.liquidityfolio.com/)

**Why wasn’t I eligible for the airdrop?**  
More than an airdrop, the $AGVE token was distributed to contributors and active members of the 1Hive community, prior to a snapshot which took place on January 25th. [Here](https://forum.1hive.org/t/agave-contributor-distribution-announcement/2373) you can find info regarding the token supply, the token allocation, and the list of eligible addresses.

**How do I claim my contributor distribution?**  
If you were eligible for the contributor distribution \(Please check the list of addresses [here](https://pastebin.com/hjYcbK1k)\) your allocation of $AGVE was already sent to your wallet.

**Will there be a future airdrop?**  
Although this is pure speculation since we are a DAO and this would require a community vote there appears to be some interest in an airdrop after deployment. The airdrop could focus on attracting TVL. This portion of the airdrop can be very specifically targeted to eliminate gaming. There may also be a marketing/hype component giving people ample time to so people may participate.

**What happened during the token launch on February 28th?**  
During the token launch traders experienced high volatility due to a mistake made while opening the AGVE/HNY pool: The intended ratio of 50HNY/10,000 AGVE ratio was set at 50HNY/1000AGVE. This created a chain of events which caused extreme volatility and the team pulled the liquidity off and reinserted it in another pool \(AGVE-WETH\) at the proper ratio. Some users may have occurred in some losses, while others may have benefited from this. Please, read [Reflection on the Agave Launch ](https://forum.1hive.org/t/reflection-on-the-agave-launch/2517)to gather more context.

**I was affected by the mistake regarding the initial liquidity and bought $AGVE at a very high price. What will happen now?**  
Given that, when trading, the responsibility is of the trader, those who were heavily affected by $AGVE’s price received a compensation proposed by the team members and voted by the community, outlined in [this post](https://forum.1hive.org/t/agave-reparations-proposal/2822). 

**How can I provide liquidity and for which pair?**  
At the moment, the 3 largest pairs for $AGVE: [AGVE-WETH](https://info.honeyswap.org/pair/0xeba7cc57e6f745b8d5cab829e07346c65393d78e), [AGVE-HNY](https://info.honeyswap.org/pair/0x50a4867aee9cafd6ddc84de3ce59df027cb29084) and [AGVE-XDAI](https://info.honeyswap.org/pair/0x0e3e9cceb13c9f8c6faf7a0f00f872d6291630de). You can provide liquidity by clicking [here](https://app.honeyswap.org/#/pool) → Add Liquidity → Select which pair you want to provide liquidity for.

**Is there a bug bounty program?**  
Not yet, but it could be closely modeled after the [1hive bug bounty](../community/security/#bug-bounty)

## Staking

**Can I stake $AGVE?**  
As of May 10th, you can finally stake your Agave. [Click here](https://app.agave.finance/#/stake) to access the app

**What is the cooldown period?**  
The cool down is how long you have to wait to withdraw a stake. It is a "safety module". The idea is that you can't immediately withdraw your staked tokens, since you are staking to protect from a shortfall event.

**What is a shortfall?**  
[Click here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortfall.asp) for a definition of shortfall.

**What happens when I click on "Activate Cooldown?**  
When you activate the cooldown period you'll have to wait 10 days before unstaking your tokens. Then, you'll have 2 days to click "unstake" --&gt; window closes

**What happens if you don’t withdraw during 2 day window?**  
If you don't withdraw within the 2 days, the window closes and you have to reactivate the cooldown period.

**Do I still receive staking rewards during the cooldown period?**  
Yes! You receive staking rewards until you don't unstake your tokens.

**Where did the 500 AGAVE come from?**  
The 500 Agave \(0.5% of the total supply\) were proposed and voted by the community in one of the recent votes. [Click here](https://forum.1hive.org/t/agave-votes-apr-22/3489) to read more.

**If I stake AGAVE, do i get a "stakedAGAVE" token?**  
Yes you get stkAGVE.

**Will it be possible to vote with stkAGVE too?**  
In the future this will be possible. Currently, this is not possible, but everything is in place to allow this function once we upgrade the DAO. We will be having an "unstake party" to vote when that happens.

**What happens in 6 months, does it automatically unstake?**  
Maybe. You may still have to manually unstake at that time. We’ll communicate before then about what will happen when the period ends. There won't be any loss of rewards if you don't unstake right away, but you will still have the cooldown to contend with. Our plan is that this will transition to receiving a share of the protocol rewards when it launches, in which case you wouldn't ever want to unstake.

## Alvin 

**What / Who is Alvin?**  
Alvin is an erc20 that is exchangeable \(in whole number quantities\) for a limited edition plushie of the agave logo character \(named Alvin\) and an NFT - Non Fungible Token. Inspired by the success obtained by Unisocks \(worth over 100k at the time of writing\), it’s the first collaboration \(Cross-Pollination\) between [1Hive](https://1hive.org/) and [Shenanigan](https://she.energy/).

**I want to redeem my Alvin plushie \(Or my Shweatpants\). How do I do that?**  
If you want to redeem your Alvin plushie \(or your Shenanigan Shweatpants\) you can easily do that by landing on [dripp.farm](https://www.dripp.farm/) and click on the "Buy" Button. Your item will be shipped anywhere in the world.

**How it's priced:**   
Dripp tokens are listed starting at predetermined prices of the item. Each buy/sell will move the price. The increase or decrease follows a [bonding curve](https://blog.relevant.community/bonding-curves-in-depth-intuition-parametrization-d3905a681e0a). Each Dripp will eventually find an equilibrium based on market demand.

**What is Dripp?**  
Dripp - [http://dripp.farm/ ](http://dripp.farm/)is the platform where users can stake their Honey, Particle or both in order to earn Alvin, Shweatpants, or both. Staking will be possible for roughly 30 days from launch. \(March 4th\)
