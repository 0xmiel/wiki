**What is the total supply of $AGVE?**  
Total Supply: 100 k  
Circulating Supply: 27,799k

**Is there a Website for Agave?**  
A brand new website is about to be ready for Agave. You can already visit the landing page at [Agave.Finance](https://agave.finance/).

**When will the product launch?**  
Most likely, within a few weeks \(end of Q1\) Agve's product should be up and running. 

**Why wasn’t I eligible for the airdrop?**  
More than an airdrop, the $AGVE token was distributed to contributors and active members of the 1Hive community, prior to a snapshot which took place on January 25th. [Here](https://forum.1hive.org/t/agave-contributor-distribution-announcement/2373) you can find info regarding the token supply, the token allocation, and the list of eligible addresses.

**How do I claim my airdrop?**  
If you were eligible for the airdrop \(Please check the list of addresses [here](https://pastebin.com/hjYcbK1k)\) your allocation of $AGVE was already sent to your wallet.

**Will there be other airdrops?**  
Although this is pure speculation at this point, the team did mention that in the future a marketing airdrop may take place.

**What happened during the token launch on February 28th?**  
During the token launch traders experienced high volatility due to a mistake made while opening the AGVE/HNY pool: The intended ratio of 50HNY/10,000 AGVE ratio was set at 50HNY/1000AGVE. This created a chain of events which caused extreme volatility and the team pulled the liquidity off and reinserted it in another pool \(AGVE-WETH\) at the proper ratio. Some users may have occurred in some losses, while others may have benefited from this. Please, read [Reflection on the Agave Launch ](https://forum.1hive.org/t/reflection-on-the-agave-launch/2517)to gather more context.

**I was affected by the mistake regarding the initial liquidity and bought $AGVE at a very high price. What will happen now?**  
Given that, when trading, the responsibility is of the trader, those who were heavily affected by $AGVE’s price will receive some sort of compensation. The team is working hard on a proposal and each member is welcome to vote for the best of the 1Hive community. A snapshot was taken to understand who was particularly affected. Please stay tuned and check official channels in order to be on the loop with everything.
