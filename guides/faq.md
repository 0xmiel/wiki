## General questions

**What is a DAO?**  
Decentralized Autonomous Organizations are coordination protocols that enable humans to work together towards a common goal by regulating interactions through rules defined in software. DAO's are unique because they put automation at the center and humans at the edges. There is no CEO, nor managers. Administration, where it must exist, is viewed as a design flaw and ruthlessly minimized.

While centralized administration is a powerful and flexible means to scale human coordination, the advent of decentralized ledgers like Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown how disruptive, powerful, and resilient **sufficiently decentralized** coordination protocols can be. DAOs do not replace companies. Instead they alter the economic landscape by creating novel markets and opportunities in which individuals and companies can participate.

In the case of the 1Hive DAO, a community currency called Honey is used to create a circular economy where public goods and investments that grow the 1Hive economy can be collectively funded with [**conviction voting**](../projects/honey/).

**Does 1Hive have a roadmap?**  
We have rough [milestones](../community/1hive-updates.md) updated by individual swarms.

## Tokenomics

**What is the Honey \(HNY\) token address?**  
[0x71850b7E9Ee3f13Ab46d67167341E4bDc905Eef9](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/tokens/0x71850b7E9Ee3f13Ab46d67167341E4bDc905Eef9/)

**Why Honey?**  
Issuing a digital currency allows a community like 1Hive to build an economy.

Holding a specific community currency is a bet on the future growth of that communities economy. The more people who hold the currency, the more people who will have interest in participating and growing the economy.

Each community may adopt different social norms and may use different issuance and distribution policies to allocate shared resources. The most effective communities will thrive and grow, competing for the attention and loyalty of individuals. Choosing to hold a specific currency will evolve beyond just a financial decision into a political and social one as well.

This type of competition is good for everyone, and should hopefully lead to a future that is more free, fair, open, and humane.

**What is the current market cap of Honey?**  
Market cap can be found here on [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/honey). 

**How is Honey's market cap calculated?**  
Market cap = \(Total Supply - Common Pool\) x Honey Price 

**What is the common pool?**

**What is the common pool address and where can the token transfers be viewed?**  
[0x05e42c4Ae51BA28d8aCF8c371009AD7138312CA4](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0x05e42c4Ae51BA28d8aCF8c371009AD7138312CA4/token-transfers)

**What is Honey's Issuance Policy?**

## xDai

**Are transaction fees really less than $0.01 \($1 = 1 xDai\)?**   
Yes, setting Gas Price = 1 should be enough to confirm all transactions.
