# For Liquidity Providers

## Liquidity Provider ROI

Liquidity Providers are rewarded with swap fees for maintaining a constant 50:50 split between two assets. If one asset appreciates with respect to the other, holding this position represents an opportunity cost often referred to as impermanent loss. 

Swap fees are split among all liquidity providers in a pool proportionally to their share of liquidity in the pool, and the amount of fees captured is a function of the trading volume on the pair. 

The ROI for providing liquidity is highest when the ratio of liquidity to volume is high, and the pair of assets are highly correlated.
