# For Traders

## Consider the total cost to trade 

Prices and Liquidity vary between exchanges, to make sure you are getting the best deal it's important to consider the _**total cost to trade**_. This includes not just the spot price, but transaction overhead \(such as gas fees\), trade overhead \(broker, liquidity, and platform fees\), as well as the slippage given the size of your trade and the available liquidity on each exchange. 

Honeyswap is on xDai and so the transaction overhead is neglible. Compared to Uniswap and other Ethereum based decentralized exchanges, where transaction overhead can often be between 5 and 20 dollars per trade depending on network congestion, trading on Honeyswap can reduce your transaction overhead significantly. 

Honeyswap has the same trade overhead as Uniswap, a 0.3% fee on each trade. For reference maker and taker fees on Coinbase are currently 0.5%. 

Honeyswap is still a very small exchange and liquidity for many assets is much lower than on other exchanges so traders may experience greater price slippage which must be factored into their total cost to trade. This effect is greater the larger the size of the trade.  

Bottom line, **If you are interested in making many small trades then Honeyswap will often have a much lower total cost to trade than other alternatives.**
