# Honeyswap

Honeyswap is a decentralized exchange built on the [xDai Chain](https://www.xdaichain.com/), this enables users to experience fast and secure transactions with incredibly low fees. Multiple tokens are available with which you can swap and add liquidity.

Analytics like volume, liquidity and transactions can be found [here](https://info.honeyswap.org).

1Hive and Honeyswap are integrated,  a portion \(?%\) of the collected fees on the exchange are used to buy the honey token and deposit it to the [common pool](../honey/#economic-overview), so as the exchange's volume increases, buy pressure on honey increases as well as the responsibility of honey holders to allocate tokens in a productive manner through the DAO's [governance](../honey/participation.md).
