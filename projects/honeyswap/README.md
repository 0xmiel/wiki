# Honeyswap

## Introduction

Honeyswap is comprised of decentralized exchange contracts deployed to multiple EVM compatible blockchain networks which share common frontend interfaces that are maintained by the 1Hive community. Currently Honeyswap supports xDai and Polygon, but will expand to other EVM chains and rollups in the future. 

Every Honeyswap deployment contributes a portion of swap fees back to the 1Hive community in the form of automated **Honey** repurchasing. In return the 1Hive community develops, maintains, supports, and promotes adoption and network effects for all of the Honeyswap deployments. 

Additionally each Honeyswap deployment has an associated **Comb** **token** which is also repurchased using swap fees. These Comb tokens are used to supplement incentives for liquidity contributions through farming rewards associated with a particular network's deployment. 

Swap fees on Honeyswap are split 1/12 to Honey, 1/12 to associated Comb token, and 5/6 directly to the pool of liquidity providers facilitating the swap. 

## Honeyswap Frontend

The [Honeyswap frontend](https://app.honeyswap.org) is maintained by 1Hive and provides an open source interface for trading and pooling liquidity. It also supports routing trades to third-party liquidity pools so that users can be sure they are getting the best trade execution when they choose to interact using Honeyswap's frontend. 

You can connect to Honeyswap from any supported network, and will be able to interact with the pool on that network. 

## Honeyswap Analytics 

[Honeyswap Analytics](https://info.honeyswap.org) is maintained by 1Hive and provides an open source interface for analyzing liquidity, volume, and trading history. 

## Honeycomb Asset Manager 

Honeycomb is maintained by 1Hive and provides an open source interface for managing DeFi positions, including depositing and withdrawing from Comb farms. 

## Honeyswap Deployments

The contracts and associated parameters associated with different Honeyswap deployments are similar but not identical. Please see the relevant sub-sections of this page for detailed information associated with specific deployments.
