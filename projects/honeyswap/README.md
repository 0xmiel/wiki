# Honeyswap

As Ethereum scales we expect to see the bulk of transactions on L1 to shift to settlement of L2 transactions. The bulk of applications and capital will be used on EVM compatible rollups. In the short term sidechains like xDai, Matic, and others will continue to play a role, but as EVM capable L2 tech matures sidechains will be upgraded to L2 rollups that inherit security from Ethereum or become significantly less relevant as users move to L2 solutions that offer a better cost-for-security proposition. 

This network topology introduces some new challenges, each L2 chain will have transaction composability locally, enabling composite transaction to settle atomically, but it will not be possible to create atomic cross-chain interactions. This means that while each L2 chain will have a unique set of applications and protocols running, there are likely to be common primitives, like swapping, that must be deployed on every L2 chain. 

With these considerations in mind Honeyswap v2 introduces a multi-token farming model to enable cross-chain network effects associated with support, development, and promotion with localized farming incentives to effectively allocate resources to LP providers on each chain. 

## Honey and Comb Tokens 

A portion of all swap fees on Honeyswap are used to support the platform by repurchasing Honey and Comb tokens. 

Honey is the community currency of 1Hive, and has been used by the 1Hive community to fund, support, and promote Honeyswap. Comb tokens are fixed supply tokens associated with each supported chain, for example xComb for xDai and pComb for Polygon and are distributed to LPs via farming. 

### AMM Upgrades











 











Honeyswap is a decentralized exchange built on the [xDai Chain](https://www.xdaichain.com/), this enables users to experience fast and secure transactions with incredibly low fees. Multiple tokens are available with which you can swap and add liquidity.

Analytics like volume, liquidity and transactions can be found [here](https://info.honeyswap.org).

1Hive and Honeyswap are integrated, 0.05% of the collected fees on the exchange are used to buy the honey token and deposit it to the [common pool](../honey/#economic-overview), so as the exchange's volume increases, buy pressure on honey increases as well as the responsibility of honey holders to allocate tokens in a productive manner through the DAO's [governance](../honey/participation.md).
