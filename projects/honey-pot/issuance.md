# Issuance

Issuance refers to the process that creates new Honey. Honey is currently set to inflate in supply 30% per year and is put straight into the Honey Pot's Common Pool, available to be requested through proposals.

Issuance is compounded dependant on how regularly new Issuance is created by users executing the issuance function. Issuance can be executed by submitting the transaction that occurs when clicking the HNY icon on the 1hive DAO page.

You can view the token supply and execute issuance here: [https://1hive.org/](https://1hive.org/#/home)

In future Issuance will be dynamic. The common pool will increase when it is below a certain threshold and decrease when it is above. This is currently in development. See the [`#ðŸŒœluna`](https://discord.gg/efpG78vZ4q) discord channel for more info.
