# Issuance

You can view token supply here [https://1hive.org/](https://1hive.org/#/home)

Issuance is currently set to 30% per year.

Issuance is compounded dependant on how regularly new Issuance is created by users executing the necessary issuance function. Issuance can be executed by submitting the transaction that occurs when clicking the HNY icon on the home page.

In future Issuance will be dynamic. The common pool will increase when it is below a certain threshold and decrease when it is above. This is currently in development. See the [`#ðŸŒœluna`](https://discord.gg/efpG78vZ4q) channel for more info.
