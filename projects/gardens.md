# Gardens

Visit the [Gardens documentation](https://1hive.gitbook.io/gardens/) for more detailed information.

Gardens are a generalization of the infrastructure the 1Hive protocol uses. This will enable other communities to experiment with a similar setup, allowing them to raise funds and make decisions amongst themselves effectively, signal attention, prioritize proposals, and collectively allocate shared resources. Through Gardens, communities can launch their own token with their own issuance policy or use an existing token. To give a new token value they can provide some Honey during the creation process to create some initial liquidity, they may also convince the 1Hive community to give up some Honey to provide more liquidity. From there they can use whatever tools they like for coordination; chat rooms, forums, etc, and the token will be used for deciding how funds are used and how their infrastructure is configured, the same as the 1Hive protocol.

We hope that this will encourage and give more opportunities to people to contribute to causes they care about. Since having a say in a Garden is as simple as buying its token, individuals can very easily donate and have a stake in a cause they believe is worth pursuing. They are then incentivized to further that cause in the hope of increasing its tokenâ€™s value. This is not too dissimilar to equity in traditional businesses but with significantly less overhead and significantly greater inclusivity.

To begin with, it is expected that Gardens will be created for software-based projects and online communities, but ultimately it is hoped it could be used for any causes that belong in the public domain.

### Problem

Tokenized Communities are powerful forces, but reaching majority consensus as a community is difficult and divisive. Voting is expensive \(on Mainnet\) and often only attractive to whales that have high confidence that their vote will be decisive. This has a negative effect on participation and weakens the feeling of voice and influence that helps nurture a sense of broad community ownership.

### Solution

Gardens enable tokenized communities to more easily leverage conviction voting, a novel consensus process, that proportionally represents the interest of active community members, and for users to more easily participate across a wide range of communities they care about. 

* Traditional online communities that have yet to tokenize, such as open-source projects,  can use the platform to tokenize, reward contributions with tokens, and allow patrons to buy tokens and use them to signal priorities by staking on proposals.
* Projects with an existing token can use the platform to improve engagement with their communities by directing a portion of onchain cash flows into a community-directed pool, or simply allowing token holders to act as patrons, curating and prioritizing important features and milestones. 

### Planned Functionality

* Users will be able to browse, discover, and join \(by purchasing tokens on Honeyswap\) communities on an interface provided on [1hive.org](www.1hive.org).
  * The ranking of communities in this list will be determined by the amount of Honey held in the corresponding liquidity pools on Honeyswap.
* Individual communities pages will be accessible at 1hive.org/\#/&lt;community-name&gt;
* Proposal metadata, user profiles, and comments will all be stored on IPFS allowing alternative interfaces to be created and offered in a decentralized and permissionless fashion. 
  * To remain visible on the interface that is made available on 1hive.org, users and communities would need to adhere to the 1Hive Community Covenant.
