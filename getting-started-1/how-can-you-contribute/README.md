# How to Contribute

1Hive is an open community, if you would like to help with something, then get involved! We are the vanguard of decentralized organizations, testing and exploring different alternatives for the future, and we would like you to be part of this adventure too.

Anyone can come and start contributing. The source of 1Hive's potential is the community, this is where the enormous power of DAOs come from: they can tap into the vast talents members have and benefit everyone by doing so.

## How to Contribute

Interact, share ideas, and join the discussion in our platforms. Sign up to the weekly Pollen distribution and [earn pollen](pollen.md), which rewards individuals for contributing to Discourse, Discord, and/or Github.

You can discuss new ideas with the relevant [Swarm](../../community/swarms/) and if it doesn't fit anywhere or it's something that requires independent work, you can create a [proposal](../../projects/honey/participation.md#proposals) for funding to do it independently.

You can also get involved with the DAO's governance by either [creating or voting on a proposal ](../../projects/honey/)at 1hive.org

## How to get Honey

Honey is the community currency of 1Hive, it is also an important community boundary. In order to influence the direction of 1Hive, Honey holders can stake their honey on proposals.

In order to participate in this process you must first acquire some Honey. Currently there are 5 primary ways to do this:

1. Get validated on [BrightId](../../guides/brightid.md) then register and claim free Honey from the [faucet](https://faucet.1hive.org/#/). 
2. Contribute to the 1Hive community on [GitHub](https://github.com/1Hive), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/P4rRDUKTAU), and [Discourse](https://forum.1hive.org/). These contributions are tracked using SourceCred and [Earn Pollen](pollen.md), which is like a contributor score. Honey is distributed weekly on the basis of these scores. 
3. Help out around the community and you may be spotted by one of the [Fauna](../../community/swarms/fauna.md) members and [awarded for your help](fauna-awards.md). 
4. Look for something you can do to improve 1Hive and submit a funding proposal to the [1Hive DAO](../../projects/honey/participation.md). 
5. Buy Honey on [Honeyswap](https://honeyswap.org/#/swap) with xDai and other cryptocurrencies.
