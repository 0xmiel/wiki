# Earn Pollen

Pollen is a contributor rank used to recognise contributions to 1Hive‚Äôs [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/P4rRDUKTAU), [Discourse](https://forum.1hive.org/), and [Github](https://github.com/1Hive) communities, and reward these contributions with weekly distributions of Honey.

## How do I participate

As soon as you start interacting on 1hive‚Äôs Discord, Discourse, and Github communities you‚Äôll start earning Pollen.

Pollen is computed using Sourcecred to create and analyze a graph of interactions between community members. While not a perfect representation of the value of contributions, Pollen can help reward the interactions that are so important but too granular to warrant creating proposals for or claiming from a swarm.

In order to receive weekly pollen distributions you‚Äôll need to register your accounts on supported platforms and link them to your xDai address. You can do this by posting in 1hive Discord‚Äôs `#üêõonboarding` channel:

```text
#üèµpollen
github: justabee
discourse: justabee
discord: justabee#1234
xDai: 0x0...000
```

Replacing "justabee\#1234" and "0x0...000" with your accounts.

If you have questions, are interested in how pollen is calculated, or auditing the distributions, just hop on the [`#üèµpollen`](https://discord.gg/y8fPNcNdAa) channel.

## Rules

Due to the infancy of the SourceCred software there are still some ways to exploit it. Various parameter changes have minimised this risk but 1Hive still imposes the following rules, which are known and monitored by many in the community.

1. **One account per user policy** A user is not allowed to own and operate multiple accounts
2. **No reactions/likes trading allowed** Entering agreements with other users to like/react each other‚Äôs posts is not allowed. Reactions/Likes trading is defined by a pattern of 2 or more users mutually reacting to most or all of each other‚Äôs posts, **regardless of the quality of the content.**
3. **Bug use / Exploits / Manipulation** If you find a bug or exploit in the system, please report it immediately. Those using a bug or exploit to their advantage may risk account deactivation.
