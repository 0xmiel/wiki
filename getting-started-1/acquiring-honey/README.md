# Acquiring Honey

Honey is the community currency of 1Hive, it is also an important community boundary. In order to influence the direction of 1Hive, Honey holders \(also called **keepers**\) can stake their honey on proposals.

In order to participate in this process you must first acquire some Honey. Currently there are 4 primary ways to do this:

1. Get validated on [BrightId](../../guides/brightid.md) and register and claim free Honey from the [faucet](https://faucet.1hive.org/#/). 
2. Contribute to the 1Hive community on [GitHub](https://github.com/1Hive), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/P4rRDUKTAU), and [Discourse](https://forum.1hive.org/). These contributions are tracked using SourceCred and [Earn Pollen](earn-pollen.md), which is like a contributor score. Honey is distributed weekly on the basis of these scores. 
3. Help out around the community and you may be spotted by one of the [Fauna](../../community/swarms/fauna.md) members and [awarded for your help](fauna-awards.md). 
4. Look for something you can do to improve 1Hive and submit a funding proposal to the [Honey Pot](../../projects/honey/). 
5. Buy honey on [Honeyswap](https://honeyswap.org/#/swap) with xDai and other cryptocurrencies.
