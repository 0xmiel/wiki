# Contributing

1Hive is an open community, if you would like to help with something, then get involved! We are the vanguard of decentralized organizations, testing and exploring different alternatives for the future, and we would like you to be part of this adventure too.

Anyone can come and start contributing. The source of 1Hive's potential is the community, this is where the enormous power of DAOs come from: they can tap into the vast talents members have and benefit everyone by doing so.

## How to Contribute

Interact, share ideas, and join the discussion in our platforms. Sign up to the weekly Pollen distribution and [earn pollen](../pollen.md), which rewards individuals for contributing to Discourse, Discord, and/or Github.

You can discuss new ideas with the relevant [Swarm](../../community/swarms/) and if it doesn't fit anywhere or it's something that requires independent work, you can create a [proposal](../../projects/honey/participation.md#proposals) for funding to do it independently.

Check out the [Buzz Bounties](buzz-bounty.md) for media and communication related work.

Help out around the community and you may be spotted by one of the [Fauna](../../community/swarms/fauna.md) members and [awarded for your help](fauna-awards.md).
