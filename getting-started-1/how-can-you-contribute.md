# How to Contribute

1Hive is an open community, if you see something that needs doing then get involved and try and fix it. 

You can discuss issues with the relevant [Swarm](../community/swarms/) and if it doesn't fit anywhere or it's something that requires independent work, you can create a proposal for funding to do it independently.

Sign up to the weekly Pollen distribution and [earn pollen](acquiring-honey/earn-pollen.md) which rewards individuals for contributing to the Discourse, Discord and Github.

Contribute to governance by either [creating or voting on a proposal ](../projects/honey-pot/)in 1hive.org
