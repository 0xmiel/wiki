# Quick Navigation Guide

Most things in 1Hive are referred to using references to the natural world. Below is a brief description of various references used to refer to **Projects** and **Swarms**.

## Projects

\*\*\*\*[**Honey Pot**](../projects/honey-pot/) ****- The central interface for on chain governance of 1Hive and for distributing funds. It uses conviction voting to create a slow organic release of funds from the common pool and displays 1Hive DAO configuration votes.

[**Honeyswap**](../projects/honeyswap/) - A fork of Uniswap v2 on xDai, the fees from which are sent to the 1Hive common pool. It includes an analytics dashboard.

\*\*\*\*[**Honeycomb**](../projects/honeyswap/honeycomb.md) ****- Defi liquidity farm's available on xDai. Incentivising liquidity provision on Honeyswap exchange pairs.

\*\*\*\*[**Honey Faucet**](../projects/honey-faucet.md) - A faucet distributing free honey once every 48 hours. It requires the user be verified on [BrightId](../guides/brightid/). The amount that is claimable is dependant on the number of registered users during a particular period.

[**Celeste**](../projects/celeste.md) - A project and swarm working on a decentralized dispute resolution protocol, also referred to as a subjective oracle, based on Aragon Court that incorporates Bright ID to make participation less capital intensive. It will be used, among other things, to enforce the 1Hive Community Covenant.

[**Gardens**](../projects/gardens.md) - A project and swarm developing 1hive.org aka [**Honey Pot**](../projects/honey-pot/) which aspires to become a web3 social network connecting people together and redefining the future of work. Currently it provides an interface for Honey distribution through Conviction Voting, but it will be extended to support the creation and operation of independent swarms.

## Swarms

**Tulip** - Work related to trading and DeFi infrastructure including Honeyswap, a fork of uniswap v2 that will incentivize liquidity provision using Honey. And other “Bee-Fi” related projects.

\*\*\*\*[**Buzz**](../community/swarms/buzz.md) - A swarm focussed on communicating, documenting, and generally spreading awareness about 1Hive and Honey to help cross-pollinate our ideas to the rest of the world. Also makes honey memes.

\*\*\*\*[**Pollen**](../community/swarms/pollen.md) - A swarm and system that maintains our SourceCred instance to distribute Honey based on contributions in Discord, Discourse \(the Forum\) and Github.

**Flora** - Work related to dev ops, infrastructure and node operations. Flora is currently exploring running a validators and emerging roll-up chains.

\*\*\*\*[**Fauna**](../community/swarms/fauna.md) ****- A swarm dedicated to moderation of our discussion channels. Members of this swarm are the ones you're likely to come in contact with should you need help with anything.

\*\*\*\*[**Morphosis**](../community/swarms/morphosis.md) ****- A swarm creating educational content and running online courses in various subjects including analytics and development. Morphosis hopes to enable and encourage more contribution to the 1Hive ecosystem.

\*\*\*\*[**Luna**](../community/swarms/luna.md) ****- A swarm that is focussed on modelling and simulation of economic principles to help inform concepts and configuration for various applications within the 1Hive ecosystem.
