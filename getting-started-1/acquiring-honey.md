# Acquiring Honey

Honey is the community currency of 1hive, it is also an important community boundary. In order to influence the direction of 1hive, honey holders \(also called **keepers**\) can stake their honey on proposals.

In order to participate in this process you must first acquire some honey. Currently there are 4 primary ways to do this:

1. Get validated on Bright ID and register and claim honey from the [faucet](https://faucet.1hive.org/#/).
2. Contribute to the 1hive community on Github, Discord, and Discourse. These contributions are tracked using SourceCred to generate Pollen, which is like a contributor score. Honey is distributed weekly on the basis of these scores.
3. Look for something you can do to improve 1hive and submit a funding proposal to [the DAO](https://1hive.org/#/home).
4. Buy honey on [Honeyswap](https://honeyswap.org/#/swap).
