# üåê Commons

{% hint style="info" %}
This Swarm used to be referred to as the Gardens Swarm but they updated their name to the Commons Swarm to more accurately reflect the project's goals.
{% endhint %}

The üåêCommons Swarm manages the development of the Commons Template and associated Aragon Apps and is doing the initial experiments into how Commons should best be structured. Updates can be seen on [Token Engineering Commons](https://tecommons.medium.com/) medium page.

Commons DAO's are a social, financial, and technical foundation for online communities to organize. This empowers people to coordinate around causes, social movements, or even memes. Commons are designed to be operationally decentralized and autonomous from day one.

## How Funds Are Used

This HNY will pay devs a rate of 25-50 xDAI an hour. As the project evolves more individual agreements might need to be made \(Bounties for tasks, etc\) but the hourly rate will stay around 25-50 xDAI/hr \(based on experience\) for the foreseeable future.

Honey is Money \(but it‚Äôs not a great unit of account \) All payments will happen in HNY, but based on the exchange rate of the date that the vote to pay out is made.

We have open accounting and you can see exactly how payments are handled and what everyone did to deserve them in this spreadsheet: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oRDecU-weSTOLv061N5O7VAJcDfU5XGqmu21ntTXOos/edit\#gid=1361585578](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oRDecU-weSTOLv061N5O7VAJcDfU5XGqmu21ntTXOos/edit#gid=1361585578)
