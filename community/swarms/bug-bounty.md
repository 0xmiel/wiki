# üêõ Bug Bounty

A bug bounty program is a deal offered by many websites, organizations and software developers by which individuals can receive recognition and compensation for reporting bugs, especially those pertaining to security exploits and vulnerabilities.

This program covers all currently deployed 1Hive related smart contracts on the xDai network that are actively being used from the 1hive Github organization: [https://github.com/1Hive/](https://github.com/1Hive/) . Contracts that 1hive uses that are not built by 1hive community members may also be considered depending on the extent to which they have been used within the 1hive ecosystem and the consequences they could produce. This evaluation will be at the discretion of the seed group members using the CVSS Risk Rating scale [https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0.](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0.)

## Requirements

1. Disclosure of issues must be made directly to one of the seed group members \(email or similar in final version\). 
2. Any evidence of disclosure to other parties will forfeit the reward. 
3. Exploiting the vulnerability prior to disclosing it will forfeit the reward. 
4. Disclosure should include details of how to reproduce the bug in as clear a way as possible. A more detailed report is likely to increase the reward. 
5. Reporting a bug that has already been reported will not earn a reward. 
6. Front-end bugs will not earn a reward.

## Risk Rating

 The severity of an issue will be determined by a score created using the CVSS Risk Rating scale [https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0) . It will likely also involve some subjective understanding of the potential impact it could make on the 1Hive ecosystem.

| Risk Rating | Payment |
| :---: | :---: |
| Critical \(9.0-10.0\): | Up to $40,000 in HNY |
| High \(7.0-8.9\): | Up to $10,000 in HNY |
| Medium \(4.0-6.9\): | Up to $2,000 in HNY |
| Low \(0.1-3.9\): | Up to $1,000 in HNY |
