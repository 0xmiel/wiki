# ðŸ¦‹ Morphosis

The ðŸ¦‹Morphosis Swarm purpose is providing education and courses for 1hive members to learn various skills. These skills will allow people to make high value contributions to 1hive and other organizations in the blockchain/DAO space. While the classes will initially be focused on skill sets that are internally valuable to the 1hive community.

## Expectations 

1. Most lectures and resources will be a sync and available to students through the week. 
2. There will be at least one  workshop per week that is live time with the instructor, and will be focused on an assignment, and answering questions from students that came up during the week. 
3. The instructor will be available for the rest of the a sync in discord to help students.
