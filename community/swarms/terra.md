# üåç Terra

The üåç Terra Swarm is responsible for translating documentation from other swarms, keeping the wiki updated in every language, and managing the new 1Hive international discord server. Also, Terra DAO members assist in creating other DAOs, especially in terms of making the text SEO-friendly as it requires a specific skill set.
