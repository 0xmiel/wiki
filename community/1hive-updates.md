# 1Hive Updates

The 1hive communication channels are public. If you read and attended public chats, discord channels, discourse, telegram and other various public communications you can infer a rough idea of what people are doing. This page is used for consolidating activities that maybe occurring. This is for people who don't have 20 hours a day to read every post on all these sources of communication. 

The 3 sections in this document are defined as follows: 

1. **Updates section** include many small and large changes in 1hive that are already complete. This is not an exhaustive list of everything completed but should contain as much as possible.
2. **List of Activities section** mostly large projects showing some activity . 
3. **Other projects important to 1hive section** is a list of work that other protocols and projects that may have an impact to some of what 1hive is trying to do.
