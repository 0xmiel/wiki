# Discord

## Channels

* **✅check-in** is for status updates from 1Hive contributors.
* **🍄nominations** is where you can recognize the work of others, particularly those that you feel are not being properly recognized elsewhere.
* **🍀general** is where discussion that doesn't fall under any other channel takes place. As the header says, it's for "All the things!"
* **🐛onboarding** is where you check the pinned message and follow the instructions to opt in to receive pollen.
* **🧚roles** is where you go to self-assign your roles for swarms and more.
* **⛈help** is where you go to receive or give aid for anything 1Hive or Honeyswap related. There is also  ⛈**help-es**, the Spanish help channel, and ⛈**help-fr**, the French help channel.
* **🍯honey** is used as a speculation channel: for discussing Honey price, speculation, financial discussions, faucet etc.
* **🌾honeycomb** is for assistance with and discussions about the [Honeycomb](https://hny.farm/farms).

## Roles

Roles are self-assigned using the 🧚**roles** channel. Assigning yourself a role gives you access to both the discussion channel for that swarm as well as to the working group channel, designated by a hexagon in the channel name.

* 🌻 **gardens** is developing 1Hive.org which aspires to become a web3 social network connecting people together and redefining the future of work. Currently it provides an interface for Honey distribution, but will be extended to support the creation and operation of swarms.
* 🌺**flora** works on dev ops, infrastructure and node operations. Flora is currently exploring running a validators and emerging roll-up chains.
* 🌷**tulip** is working on trading and DeFi infrastructure including Honeyswap, a fork of uniswap v2 that will incentivize liquidity provision using Honey.
* 🌞**celeste** is working on a decentralized dispute resolution protocol based on Aragon Court that incorporates Bright ID to make participation less capital intensive. It will be used, among other things, to enforce the 1Hive community covenant.
* 🐝**buzz** is focused on communicating, documenting, and generally spreading awareness about 1Hive and Honey.
* 🏵**pollen** maintains our SourceCred instance to distribute Honey based on contributions.
* **🌾dev** is the buidlers of the community. They are making the world better by making better things!
