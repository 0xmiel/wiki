## Roles and Swarms

Roles are self-assigned using the 🧚**roles** channel. Assigning yourself a role gives you access to the swarm working group channel, designated by a hexagon **⏣** in the channel name. These are under the **SWARMS** heading on 1Hive's Discord. Although 🌈**design** is not a **SWARM** it is a role, so it's included in this section as well. The **SWARM** channels include 🌻**gardens-⏣, 🌷tulip-⏣, 🌺flora-⏣, 🌞celeste-⏣, 🐝buzz-⏣, 🏵pollen-⏣** and 🌈**design-⏣.**
