# Media

1Hive uses a variety of social media to communicate and organize within the community. While the primary conversation happens on our Discord and Discourse forums, the latter being used to hash out proposals, the 1Hive community is active on Telegram, Reddit, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and GitHub. There are also community members who contribute regularly on Hacker Noon and Medium.

The social media accounts for 1Hive are managed by the [Buzz Swarm](../swarms/buzz.md), which, in addition to almost constant dialoging on Discord on the two Buzz Swarm channels, also has regular conference calls. A Buzz DAO has recently been created. We look forward to sharing experiences in decentralized promotion.
