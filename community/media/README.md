# Media

1Hive uses a variety of social media to communicate and organize within the community. While the primary conversation happens on our Discord and Discourse forums, the 1Hive community is also active on Telegram, Reddit, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and GitHub. There are also community members who contribute regularly on Hacker Noon and Medium.

1Hive and Honeyswap social media accounts are managed by the [Buzz Swarm](../swarms/buzz.md), which, is in constant dialogue on Discord through the Buzz Swarm channels, as well as having regular meetings. A Buzz DAO has recently been created. We look forward to sharing experiences in decentralized promotion.
