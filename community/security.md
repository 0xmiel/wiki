## Security Audits

Currently 1Hive does not audit it's code, see this note regarding this:

However, we did have an audit for Dandelion. ConsenSys Diligence conducted a security audit of 1Hiveâ€™s Dandelion org template and supporting apps. Dandelion orgs are a DAO template that function similarly to MolochDAO, and are comprised of a suite of modular Aragon apps that can be used in any DAO.
